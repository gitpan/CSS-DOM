Revision history for CSS::DOM

0.05    2 September, 2008
      • CSS::DOM now detects the encoding of CSS files and decodes
        them (if you ask it to).
      • CSS::DOM::Style  has  a  non-standard  (i.e., non-DOM)
        modification_handler method that allows the assignment
        of a handler that is called whenever the style  object
        is modified or one of its sub-objects.

      • CSS::DOM::Style’s setProperty method now works when ::Style is
        loaded before ::Parser.
      • The CSSFontFaceRule interface has been added.

0.03    19 August, 2008
      • CSS.pm is no longer used. The parsing interface has changed.
        None of the  CSS.pm-specific methods can be used  any-
        more  (read_string,  etc.).  Use CSS::DOM::parse  and
        CSS::DOM::Style::parse instead  (actually,  these are
        constructors so you should normally use these instead
        of ‘new’).
      • CSS rules no longer overload stringification.  That was some-
        thing inherited from CSS.pm’s CSS::Style. If anyone wants me
        to add it back, I can.
      • CSS::DOM::Rule’s constructor’s interface has changed, and now
        accepts the parent rule or style sheet as the  only  argument.
        (It used to inherit a constructor from CSS::Style).
      • CSS::DOM::Rule::Style has its selectorText method, so the
        CSSStyleRule interface is complete.
      • CSS::DOM::Rule now has its parentRule and parentStyleSheet
        methods, so the CSSRule interface is complete.
      • Started the CSSValue class. So far the constants and a con-
        structor (doesn’t work yet) exist.
      • Started the CSSPrimitiveValue class. So far the constants, the
        constructor and the cssText method (currently read-only)  have
        been implemented.  Counters,  rects,  and rgb() colors are not
        yet supported.  This is not actually used by the other modules
        yet, but you can play with it. It’s quite buggy.
      • The CSSMediaRule, CSSPageRule and CSSImportRule interfaces
        have been added.
      • CSS::DOM’s ownerRule and parentStyleSheet methods are actually
        capable of return useful  values  now  that  CSSImportRule  is
        implemented.
      • The CSS::DOM::StyleDecl module has been renamed to ::Style.
      • The CSS::DOM  constructor now accepts the named argument
       ‘url_fetcher’, which can be passed a coderef that will be
        called by @import rules.
      • CSS::DOM’s ownerNode now returns an empty list in list context
        instead of (undef), if there is no owner.

0.02    19 May, 2008
      • CSS::DOM  now has its title  and  media  methods  (so  the
        StyleSheet interface has been completed) and its ownerRule,
        insertRule and deleteRule methods (the CSSStyleSheet inter-
        face is now complete).
      • CSS::DOM::MediaList and CSS::DOM::StyleSheetList have
        been added.
      • CSS::DOM::Rule now has type and cssText methods (the CSSRule
        interface is complete).

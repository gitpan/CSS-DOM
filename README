CSS::DOM, version 0.07

This module implements a CSS-specific subset of the interfaces
described in the W3C DOM specification.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

(See the Changes file for the long version.)

Shorthand properties are finally supported.  This means you  can  set
‘font’ to ‘13px/15px My Font’ and have the ‘font-size’, ‘line-height’,
and ‘font-family’ properties (among others)  set automatically.  Also,
invalid property values are now ignored.  How this is done  is  speci-
fied by objects of the new  CSS::DOM::PropertyParser  class.

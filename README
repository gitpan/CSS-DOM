Oops. Fix another problem, introduced in 0.12. I forgot to add a file
to MANIFEST. (I *thought* I had run make disttest.)

Fix dependency problem introduced in 0.11.  (I tried  to  remove  the
dependency on constant::lexical, gave up and reverted my changes, but
forgot to add it back to Makefile.PL. Oh well.)

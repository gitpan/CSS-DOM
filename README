CSS::DOM, version 0.04

This module implements a CSS-specific subset of the interfaces
described in the W3C DOM specification.


RECENT CHANGES

0.04
----
• CSS::DOM::Style’s setProperty method now works when ::Style is loaded before ::Parser.
• The CSSFontFaceRule interface has been added.


0.03
----
This version breaks compatibility with older versions. Here is a
summary of the changes.  See  the  Changes  file  for  the  more
detailed version.

• CSS.pm is no longer used. The parsing interface has changed.  None
  of the  CSS.pm-specific methods can be used  anymore  (read_string,
  etc.).  Use CSS::DOM::parse and CSS::DOM::StyleDecl::parse instead
  (actually, these are constructors so you should normally use these
  instead of ‘new’).
• The CSSStyleRule and CSSRule interfaces are now complete.
• The CSSMediaRule, CSSPageRule and CSSImportRule interfaces have
   been added.
• The CSS::DOM::StyleDecl module has been renamed to ::Style.
• The CSS::DOM  constructor now accepts the named argument
 ‘url_fetcher’, which can be passed a coderef that will be
  called by @import rules.

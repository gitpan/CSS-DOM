HTML::DOM, version 0.02

This module implements a CSS-specific subset of the interfaces
described in the W3C DOM specification.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

• CSS::DOM now has its title and media methods  (so the StyleSheet
  interface has been completed) and its ownerRule,  insertRule and
  deleteRule methods (the CSSStyleSheet interface is now complete).
• CSS::DOM::MediaList and CSS::DOM::StyleSheetList have been added.
• CSS::DOM::Rule now has type and cssText methods.
